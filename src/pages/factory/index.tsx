      intent="The Factory Design Pattern in Java is a creational pattern that defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes flexibility and scalability in your codebase."
      explanation="Factory is an object for creating other objects â€“ formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class."
      programmaticExample={`
public interface Coin {
  String getDescription();
}
public class GoldCoin implements Coin {

  static final String DESCRIPTION = "This is a gold coin.";

  @Override
  public String getDescription() {
    return DESCRIPTION;
  }
}
public class CopperCoin implements Coin {
   
  static final String DESCRIPTION = "This is a copper coin.";

  @Override
  public String getDescription() {
    return DESCRIPTION;
  }
}
Enumeration below represents types of coins that we support (GoldCoin and CopperCoin).

@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Getter
public enum CoinType {

  COPPER(CopperCoin::new),
  GOLD(GoldCoin::new);

  private final Supplier<Coin> constructor;
}
Then we have the static method getCoin to create coin objects encapsulated in the factory class CoinFactory.

public class CoinFactory {

  public static Coin getCoin(CoinType type) {
    return type.getConstructor().get();
  }
}
Now, in the client code, we can generate various types of coins using the factory class.

public static void main(String[] args) {
    LOGGER.info("The alchemist begins his work.");
    var coin1 = CoinFactory.getCoin(CoinType.COPPER);
    var coin2 = CoinFactory.getCoin(CoinType.GOLD);
    LOGGER.info(coin1.getDescription());
    LOGGER.info(coin2.getDescription());
}
